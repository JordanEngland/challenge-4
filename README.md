# My Code Quiz

## Description

This is by far the most difficult project to date. Its been a good challenge. It is definitely harder to write all the code without any starter code. It has really tested the ability to be able to research docs and be able to find the right information to code. Im slowly getting a little better with doing the functions. Still have along ways to go and much to learn. Building this project helped me learn more about how to add event listeners, functions, var, timers, and much more. Excited to learn more and implement more of what im learning to the future projects. HTML and CSS is getting easier, JavaScript will get better soon.
